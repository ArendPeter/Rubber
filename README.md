# Rubber
Wrapper for IGOR.exe, aka compile gamemaker projects via command line.

This tool is called from the command line, takes in a yyz/yyp and output a zip, installer,
or just run the game. For now, this only runs on windows, compiling to windows. Alternativly
there is an api that you can call from javascript.

## Notes
I would like some of these untested features to be confirmed to work or fail, so that it can be resolved.

- ~~Project using shaders might not work~~ **Works**
- Using steam is not tested
- Running on mac not supported.
- Using configurations not tested

## Setup

You will need installed
1. GameMaker Studio 2 Desktop (inside default install directory).
1. Node.js with npm installed.

To install rubber globally, run `npm i -g gamemaker-rubber`, and you should be all good.

To use rubber as a dependency, you would use `npm i gamemaker-rubber`

## Usage
`rubber [options] path/to/project.yyp [output file]`
